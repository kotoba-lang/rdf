  "Structural validation of RDF terms, triples, and quads against RDF 1.1
  Concepts and Abstract Syntax (W3C Recommendation, 25 February 2014):
  https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/

  Returns `kotoba.dsl.problem`-shaped problems, domain `:rdf`:
  `{:rdf/severity :error|:warn :rdf/code kw :rdf/id subject :rdf/msg string}`

  This checks *structure* only (Sec 3 terms/triples, Sec 4 named-graph
  names) — it does not implement RDF's model-theoretic semantics
  (entailment, equivalence beyond term-equality, inconsistency; Sec 1.7,
  which the spec itself defers to a separate RDF 1.1 Semantics document).
  RDFS/OWL entailment-level checking belongs in `kotoba-lang/org-w3-owl2`,
  not here — this namespace never asks 'is this graph internally consistent
  under some vocabulary,' only 'is this term/triple/quad well-formed RDF.'"
